It's been a year since the release of Svelte 3, and over the year, a lot has happened in terms of community. In this post, I am collecting some highlights of the past year, from a community perspective.

I am sure you are probably pretty tired of exponential graphs by now, but here is the interest in Svelte as measured by Github stars over time.

If you like Svelte and want to support it - give it a star [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte).

* Right after the last post, Rich's talk [Rethinking Reactivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao) got a lot of people excited about Svelte. He followed this talk up with [Computer, build me an app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqt6YxAZoOc) and [The return of write less, do more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzX4aTRPzno).
* Near the end of last year, Svelte was a rising star in 2019's [State of JS](https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/).
* Multiple events have been coordinated under the Svelte Society banner. There's been 4 events in New York, an event in Stockholm, two in Amsterdam and an event in Russia (with over 100 people!).
  * A lot of these have videos of the talks, which you can find on the Svelte Society's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sveltesociety) page.
  * Sadly, some events had to be cancelled in recent weeks due to COVID-19.
* Svelte.js was talked about a lot in the overall development community. Ryan Atkinson's post [Why Svelte](https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte) became #1 on Hacker News.
* A [community site](https://svelte-community.netlify.com/) was built, with a listing of events, tools & resources and code that you can use
* Recently, Svelte was featured in [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/javascript-framework-puts-web-pages-diet/).
