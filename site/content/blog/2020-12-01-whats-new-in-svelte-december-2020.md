It's the last "What's new in Svelte" of the year... To round out the season, this month's coverage includes _things_!

## New features & impactful bug fixes

1. Transitions within `{:else}` block should now complete successfully (**3.29.5**, [Example](https://svelte.dev/repl/49cef205e5da459594ef2eafcbd41593?version=3.29.5))
2. Svelte now includes an export map, which explicitly states which files can be imported from its npm package (**3.29.5** with some fixes in **3.29.6** and **3.29.7**)

## What's going on in Sapper?
Lots of new typecript definitions to make editing Sapper apps even easier! Dynamic imports also should now work in `client.js` files. (Unreleased)

## What's the deal with SvelteKit?
We're glad you asked! If you didn't catch Rich's blog post from early last month, [you can find it here](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit)!

For all the features and bugfixes see the CHANGELOGs for [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
