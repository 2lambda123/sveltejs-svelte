It's been a year since the release of Svelte 3, and over the year, a lot has happened in terms of community. In this post, I am collecting some highlights of the past year, from a community perspective.

This graph is only one slice of the pie, but here is the interest in Svelte as measured by Github stars over time.

If you like Svelte and want to support it - give it a star [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte).

### General

* Right after the last post on this website, Rich's talk [Rethinking Reactivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao) got a lot of people excited about Svelte. He followed this talk up with [The return of write less, do more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzX4aTRPzno).
* Near the end of last year, Svelte was a rising star in 2019's [State of JS](https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/). It also received the "Prediction Award" for best upcoming technology.
* In April, Svelte was featured in [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/javascript-framework-puts-web-pages-diet/).
* Svelte.js was talked about a lot in the overall development community. Ryan Atkinson's post [Why Svelte](https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte) became #1 on Hacker News.

### Community projects

* A [community site](https://svelte-community.netlify.com/) was built, with a listing of events, tools & resources and code that you can use
    * This community site will now be re-built. Plans are being discussed in the open on [svelte-society/site](https://github.com/svelte-society/site/).

### Libraries

* Several UI libraries have been created such as [Svelte Material UI](https://github.com/hperrin/svelte-material-ui), [Svelma](https://github.com/c0bra/svelma) (based on Bulma), and [SvelteStrap](https://github.com/bestguy/sveltestrap) (based on Bootstrap 4)
* Projects like [Pancake](https://pancake-charts.surge.sh/) and [LayerCake](https://layercake.graphics/) help with building data visualizations and charts in a way that only Svelte can
* Projects like [Svelte-docs](https://github.com/AlexxNB/svelte-docs/) (a styleguide generator) and [Svench](https://github.com/rixo/svench) (a storybook alternative) provide a way to write documentation for your Svelte components
* [Routify](https://routify.dev/) is a router for Svelte - and has been getting more popular

### Community events

* An online conference was organized under the Svelte Society banner, which featured 10 talks. Check out the conference website at [sveltesociety.dev](https://sveltesociety.dev/)
* Multiple real-life events have been coordinated under the Svelte Society banner as well
    * There's been 4 events in New York, an event in Stockholm, two in Amsterdam and an event in Russia (with over 100 people!).
    * A lot of these have videos of the talks, which you can find on the Svelte Society's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sveltesociety) page.
