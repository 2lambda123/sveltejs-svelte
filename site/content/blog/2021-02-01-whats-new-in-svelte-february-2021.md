Happy new year from Svelte! In the last month we made progress on Sapper's upcoming release, fine-tuned our `SvelteComponent` typings, and have seen some amazing apps, sites, and libraries coming out in the showcase.

## New compiler features
- Aria roles from the [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/#role_definitions) are now recognized as valid aria roles in Svelte components (**3.31.1**)
- Compiler warnings for the common React attributes, `className` and `htmlFor`, now make it easier to port React components to Svelte (**3.31.1**)

Have a suggestion for a compiler feature or want to help implement new features/bug fixes? Check out the ["triage: good first issue" tag for Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22triage%3A+good+first+issue%22)


## New bits in language-tools

- User disabled auto import suggestions no longer show in VS Code (**103.0.0**)
- Renaming a variable is now safer with smart additions of a prefix/suffix to renamed variables (**104.0.0**)
- Semantic (token) highlighting for typescript users lets theme makers apply Svelte-specific styling in their themes (**104.0.0**)
- "Extract Component" has been added to the context menu - allowing you to extract components out of files without having to open the command window to type "Svelte: Extract Component" (**104.0.0**)

For the complete list of changes, check out the language-tools [Releases page](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases).

A great way to try the language tools is to download the [Svelte Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). This extension provides syntax highlighting and rich intellisense for Svelte components in VS Code, using the svelte language server. Check your editor's extension sources to see if there's a Svelte plugin for your IDE or build your own (see [coc-svelte](https://github.com/coc-extensions/coc-svelte) for example)!
