## Intro
Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.[Continue Reading](https://svelte.dev).

## What is Svelte?
Yes, you are write you came to Svelte Cybernetically enhanced web apps. Svelte is Javascript tool for building UI Components.
Unlike Angular, Vue, React and other Frameworks you know that ship javascript runtime to the browser to make your code work, Svelte itself is a compiler. I will convert your code into imperative code that works with native browser apis. With this you have a highly performant code in a small package. The only javascript framework ENJOYABLE to use.

## Code Formatting

When writing svelte app, our components are saved in .svelte extension.
Inside this file, you can write your script using script tag `<script lang=""></script>`. CSS also the same in style tag and you are free to you any preprocessor you might like.[Here](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/styling)
`<style lang=""></style>`
Write your Html in main tagged element which is which is empowered to writing declarative code. [See Demo](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/adding-data)

## Wrapping
Svelte is not yet done and is progressing day by day. Do you imagine how it will be looking tomorrow. It will be a complete sensation. Did you here about [Svelte Kit]()? Yeah Svelte for Server Side Rendering!

So Svelte keeps getting better and it is your right choice to start building web apps.
