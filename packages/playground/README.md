You may use this package to experiment with your changes to Svelte.

To prevent any changes you make from being committed, run `git update-index --skip-worktree ./**/*.*` in this directory.

If you would actually like to make some changes to the files here for everyone then run `git update-index --no-skip-worktree ./**/*.*` before committing.
