Svelte Summit was last week - featuring a number of fantastic talks from across the community. In the final talk, What You Can Do For Your Framework, Rich Harris (with a little help from PuruVJ's neoconfetti library) [announced that Svelte 5 is now in the "Release Candidate"](https://www.youtube.com/live/gkJ09joGBZ4?si=O5HR0PF-TDvNdVNf&t=8898).
