To try Svelte in an interactive online environment you can try [the REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl) or [StackBlitz](https://node.new/svelte).

To create a project locally we recommend using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), the official application framework from the Svelte team. It will handle calling [the Svelte compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte) to convert your `.svelte` files to `.js` and `.css` . It also provides all the other pieces you need to build a web application such as routing and deployment. There are [plugins to handle Svelte compilation](https://sveltesociety.dev/tools#bundling) for all the major web bundlers, but we recommend using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which SvelteKit sets up automatically.

The Svelte team maintains a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) and there are integrations with various other [editors](https://sveltesociety.dev/tools#editor-support) and tools as well.

If you're having trouble, get help on [Discord](https://svelte.dev/chat) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/svelte).
