title: Statements
---

We're not limited to declaring reactive *values* â€” we can also run arbitrary *statements* reactively. For example, we can log the value of `count` whenever it changes:

```js
$: console.log(`the count is ${count}`);
```

> Did you notice we are using [template literal syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals "MDN Web Docs") here? `the count is ${count}` is enclosed by `` ` `` backticks, **not** `'` quotes. This enables us to substitute it with reactive declarations, `${count}` for example. 

You can easily group statements together with a block:

```js
$: {
	console.log(`the count is ${count}`);
	alert(`I SAID THE COUNT IS ${count}`);
}
```

You can even put the `$:` in front of things like `if` blocks:

```js
$: if (count >= 10) {
	alert(`count is dangerously high!`);
	count = 9;
}
```
