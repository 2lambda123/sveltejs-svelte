## What's new in Svelte, SvelteKit & Language Tools

[Svelte 5 preview](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/introduction) is now available at [svelte@next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte?activeTab=versions) while Svelte 4's current version (`@latest`) is `4.2.7`.

For all the release notes going forward, check out [the CHANGELOG on main](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md). For the highlights, take a look below!

- TypeScript is now supported natively via acorn-typescript (**5.0.0-next.9**, [#9482](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9482))
- The new `$effect.active` rune returns a boolean to indicate if an effect is active. This lets you set up subscriptions when a value is read (in an effect, or in the template) but also read values without creating subscriptions (**5.0.0-next.10**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#effect-active), [#9591](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9591))
- The new `$effect.root` rune creates a non-tracked scope that doesn't auto-cleanup. This is useful for nested effects that you want to manually control (**5.0.0-next.14**, **Docs**, [#9638](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9638))
- The latest version of language tools adds best-effort fallback typings to `$props()` rune (**extensions-108.1.0**)
- Language tools better supports the `@render` tag by using the `Snippet` type (**extensions-108.0.0**)

For a complete list of bug fixes and performance updates, check out the [SvelteKit CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md). You can also find adapter-specific CHANGELOGs in each of [the `adapter` directories](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages).
