With SvelteKit crossing both the [80% complete mark](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/milestone/2) _and_ over [5000 stars](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) on GitHub, now is a great time to try it out! Many in the community have, making for quite a large showcase this month...

Also, don't miss out on [Svelte Summit](https://sveltesummit.com/) on November 20th - featuring speakers from around the world. Keep an eye out for a watch party in your area üëÄ

Now onto what's new!

## New in Svelte and SvelteKit

- A new compiler option, `enableSourcemap`, provides more control over the compiler output for JS and CSS sourcemaps (**3.44.0**). With this new feature, SvelteKit and the Vite Svelte plugin can now properly handle environment variables (See [sveltejs/kit#720](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/720) and [sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte#201](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/pull/201))
- The Svelte Language Tools now support configuring the VS Code CSS Language Service settings ([#1219](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/1219))
- SvelteKit will only route endpoints on the client, unless marked as `rel="external"` - reducing the size of the client JS and making it easier to refactor the router in the future ([2656](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2656))
- SvelteKit no longer supports Node 12 ([2604](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2604))
