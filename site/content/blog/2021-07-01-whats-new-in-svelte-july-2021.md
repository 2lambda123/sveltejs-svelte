As the northern hemisphere heats up, Svelte has stayed cool with lots of performance and bug fixes, better TypeScript support, and lots of new components & tools from around the ecosystem. Let's take a peek ðŸ‘€

## New in SvelteKit
- `adapter-node` now precompresses assets using gzip & brotli ([#1693](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1693))
- Support for TypeScript transpilation has been added to the svelte package tooling ([#1633](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/1633))


## Features & bug fixes from around svelte/*
- [Svelte 3.38.3](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3383) (released June 22) includes a bunch performance and bug fixes - including hydration optimizations, `this` preservation in bubbled events, and more!
- The latest language tools releases added support for prop renaming from outside of a component, postcss syntax grammar, `.d.ts` file outputs in `svelte2tsx` and better support for TypeScript features across the board!
- `svelte-scroller` got some quality-of-life fixes in 2.0.7 - fixing an initial width bug and updating its `index` more conservatively
